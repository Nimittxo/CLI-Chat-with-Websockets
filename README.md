# CLI-Chat-with-Websockets
    CLI Chat with Websockets running on the Local Machine's IP server can be connected anywhere anytime, if the Local machine with Server script is running!


# USE
- ```pip install customtkinter``` 
(if you want to Integrate the GUI as well !)


# To Run
 - Run ```server.py``` 
    => This will start the server 
 - Now Run ```client.py ```
    => this will ask for your username enter It and you're good to go :)


## Change this !
 - In both ```server.py``` and ```client.py``` I have used my IP: ```192.168.1.12``` Change this so that It could properly run on your Local Machine.
